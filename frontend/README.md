## Architecture- Interactive D3.js-powered force-directed graph



### Components- Real-time visualization of concept relationshipsBuilds the app for production to the `build` folder.\

- **`App.tsx`** - Main application with tab navigation, WebSocket connection, and dark mode

- **`NoteManager.tsx`** - Note creation/editing interface with concept extraction- Node and edge interactions with hover effectsIt correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

- **`RecallSearch.tsx`** - Memory search interface with advanced filtering

- **`ConceptGraph.tsx`** - D3.js visualization component for relationship graphs- Zoom and pan functionality

- **`DocumentAnnotation.tsx`** - Text annotation and highlighting system

- **`DarkModeToggle.tsx`** - Theme switching component with smooth animations- Dynamic graph updates via WebSocketThe build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\



### Services & Context- Color-coded nodes by concept strengthYour app is ready to be deployed!

- **`websocket.ts`** - WebSocket client for real-time communication with Rust backend

- **`types/index.ts`** - Comprehensive TypeScript definitions for all data structures

- **`DarkModeContext.tsx`** - React context for theme management and persistence

### ‚úèÔ∏è **Document Annotation**See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### Styling

- **Tailwind CSS** with custom brain/synapse color schemes- Text highlighting and annotation system

- Neural network-inspired gradients and animations

- Responsive design with mobile-first approach- Multi-colored highlight management### `npm run eject`

- Dark mode with automatic system preference detection

- Concept creation from highlighted text

## Technology Stack

- Export functionality for annotations**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can‚Äôt go back!**

- **React 18** with TypeScript

- **D3.js v7** for data visualization- Integration with concept learning system

- **Tailwind CSS 3.4** with dark mode support

- **WebSocket API** for real-time communicationIf you aren‚Äôt satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

- **UUID** for unique identifier generation

- **React Highlight Words** for text highlighting## Architecture

- **Heroicons** for consistent iconography

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you‚Äôre on your own.

## Getting Started

### Components

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 16+ - **`App.tsx`** - Main application with tab navigation and WebSocket connection managementYou don‚Äôt have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn‚Äôt feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn‚Äôt be useful if you couldn‚Äôt customize it when you are ready for it.

- npm or yarn

### WebSocket Message Protocol### Adding New Features

The frontend communicates with the backend using structured JSON messages:1. Define types in `src/types/index.ts`

2. Update WebSocket service if backend communication needed

```typescript3. Create React components in `src/components/`

// Learn a new concept4. Add navigation in `App.tsx` if new tab required

{

  type: 'learn_concept',### WebSocket Message Protocol

  concept: string,The frontend communicates with the backend using structured JSON messages:

  context?: any

}```typescript

// Learn a new concept

// Search memory{

{  type: 'learn_concept',

  type: 'recall',  concept: string,

  query: string,  context?: any

  parameters: RecallParameters}

}

// Search memory

// Create associations{

{  type: 'recall',

  type: 'associate_concepts',  query: string,

  concept1: string,  parameters: RecallParameters

  concept2: string,}

  strength?: number

}// Create associations

```{

  type: 'associate_concepts',

## Performance Considerations  concept1: string,
